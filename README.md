############ Assignment 1.1: Your first Python Application ############

Assignment Overview
In this assignment, we will be writing our first Python application in this course to master the installation, setup, and configuration of a Python IDE to create a Python Program.

Guidelines
Download and Install Python:

Windows Version:

Python for WindowsLinks to an external site.

or run Python Online (only if unable to install Python) https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compilerLinks to an external site.

Download an IDE that supports Python, such as PyCharm, Geany or Visual Studio Code:

Visual Studio Code

Then create a Python Tutorial application on any command used in Python or a subject of your choice that uses any Python command.

For example, if you create a Python Tutorial, you may use this site as a reference. Just be sure to give it credit as your source.

https://www.w3schools.com/python/Links to an external site.

Expectations
Create a Python Tutorial application in Python on one or more Python commands used in the Python programming language or another subject of your choice.
Scope: In your Python Tutorial, you only need to include:
At least one Python command. For example, the "print" command and how to use it.
Add at least two variables holding different data types to your application.
Add user Input/Output to your application.
Create a description at the top of your program to let the user know the purpose of your program and how to use it.
Ensure your output is formatted correctly so it is legible.
Over-comment your code. Comment on every line of your code, showing your understanding of what it does and your intent in the application. Over-commenting your code is one of the best-kept secrets to learning new programming skills!
Have fun and make it memorable. It is okay to have funny content. The more humor in your assignment, the easier it is for you to remember it.
You can make your program look at least like the Sample Tutorial program output below, or make yours look different by teaching a different Python Command, or make your tutorial on some other subject you like in life instead of Python.  
 

Sample Tutorial Program Output
*** Welcome to Learn Python Because it is Really Cool Tutorial ***


In this lesson, we are going to master the "print" command in Python.
Are you ready? (Y/N)
You answered: (Hint: Y or N -  display what they typed)

What do you think the "print" command in Python is?
Okay, times up!
If you thought it was "print" you would be correct!
----------------------------------------
Here is the syntax for the "print" command in Python
print("Text to display on the screen.")
----------------------------------------
Here is how you would use the "print" command in Python to print out the phrase "I am the HAL 9000 Computer"
print("I am the HAL 9000 Computer")
The following would display in your application

I am the HAL 9000 Computer
Pro Tip: the print command must be all lowercase.
----------------------------------------
End of Tutorial... Have a nice day!

 

Deliverables / Submission
The text code file .py you wrote yourself.  
A screenshot(s) of your program running, i.e., displaying the output of your program.

############ Assignment 2.1: Loops and Decision-Making in Python ############

Assignment Overview
Your task is to create a simple simulation program with the theme of your choice. This will be a text-based simulation program where the user is presented with a situation and a set of options. Depending on what they choose, they'll be led down different paths. The game should be at least three stages deep, i.e., there should be three levels of decisions to be made.

You can choose to create an adventure in a haunted house, jungle expedition, alien planet, or any other fun scenario you can think of. Just be sure to use at least 3 sets of if, elif, and else statements, along with at least 2 loops!

Loops will save you from rewriting many lines of code, allowing us to automate repetitive tasks and make our programs more efficient. Imagine being able to execute a block of code multiple times without having to write it over and over again. That's precisely what loops enable us to do!

Lesson Guidelines
Understanding If, Else Statements: These are crucial in programming, as they enable the programs you write to make decisions on their own. By using these statements, your program can decide to execute certain portions of code based on specific conditions.
Elif Statement: Elif (else if) comes in when you need to check multiple conditions and execute different code blocks for each condition.
With the while loop, you'll learn how to create a loop that repeats as long as a certain condition is true. This is perfect for scenarios where you need to iterate until a specific condition is met.
The for loop, on the other hand, is ideal for situations where you already know or can programmatically determine how many times you want to repeat an action. Whether iterating over a sequence of elements or performing a set number of iterations, the for loop has got you covered.
Requirements and Expectations
Create a Simulation

Instructions:

Your task is to create a simple simulation program with the theme of your choice. This will be a text-based simulation program where the user is presented with a situation and a set of options. Depending on what they choose, they'll be led down different paths. The game should be at least three stages deep, i.e., there should be three levels of decisions to be made. There need to be at least 2 loops included. 

At the end, ask the user if they would like to run the sim again and replay the sim for them based on their choice (i.e., while loop).

Comment every line of code. Please refer to the grading rubric.

Here's a small example of an output of a Moonbase Sim:

Pro Tip
Remember, there's no right or wrong theme for this assignment. Pick a theme that you find interesting. The aim is to let your creativity shine while learning to use if-else statements. If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to ask!

############ Assignment 3.1: Artificial Intelligence Collaboration ############

Overview
Welcome to our Python Course's most exciting assignment so far: the AI Coding Collaboration! It is the best time ever to be alive because the future of coding is here. You are no longer coding alone. You now have a teammate from the incredible world of Artificial Intelligence. In this assignment, you'll create a dazzling app powered by Python, with most of the code written by AI. Yes, you heard that right! You will be teaming up with an AI sidekick to build your app. This is not just an assignment; it's an adventure into the forefront of technology. Whether you're major is game development, computer science, or artificial intelligence, this assignment has it all!

Your AI companions can include ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and / or other AI code-generation tools. These tools will act as your coding partners, helping you generate code, solve problems, and bring your vision to life.

Why This is Fun and Beneficial
Embrace the Future: AI is revolutionizing industries across the board. Having hands-on experience with AI in coding will make you a hot commodity in the job market. Plus, it will be super cool to say, "I built an app with AI"!

Limitless Possibilities: Your imagination is the limit! Dream up any kind of app you want. Create a game, automate your life, create a chatbot that works just for you, or even start building your own AI. You're not just learning; you're pioneering.

Skill Amplification: Working with AI will teach you new approaches to coding that you hadn't even considered. It's like pairing up with a coding guru ready to help 24/7.

Change Perspectives: This experience might be so eye-opening that you may want to major in AI. We wouldn't blame you! AI is not just a field; it's the future.

Learn to Collaborate with AI: This isn't just about coding; it's about learning how to collaborate with AI, a skill that's becoming increasingly valuable in the software development industry.

Fast and Efficient Development: AI tools can speed up your development process by providing suggestions for completing lines or blocks of code, helping you solve complex tasks in minutes that might take hours, days, weeks, or months traditionally.

Innovative Ideas: With AI by your side, you are more likely to generate innovative, out-of-the-box ideas for your app. The sky is the limit when it comes to asking your AI teammate for app ideas to create!

Learning by Doing: This hands-on project will solidify your understanding of Python, AI, and the interface between the two. Plus, there's no better way to learn than by actually doing.

Exciting Career Prospects: If you find this interesting, you might want to consider a career in AI! The demand for AI aficionados is growing dramatically. This assignment can be your first step toward that exciting journey.

Guidelines for Using AI for Coding
Define the purpose Clearly: Before you begin, have a clear understanding of what your app should do. This will guide the AI in generating relevant code.
Incremental Development: Don't ask the AI to write large chunks of code at once. Work on small pieces and iteratively improve them.
Review and Refine: AI-generated code can sometimes be suboptimal or erroneous. Always review the code and refine it as necessary.
Test Extensively: Ensure that the final product is tested thoroughly. Since a significant portion of the code is generated by AI, ensuring it runs as intended is imperative.
Seek Feedback: Use AI to generate multiple solutions and seek feedback from peers or mentors.
App Ideas and AI-Assisted Approaches
Project Ideas:

Here are some ideas to get your creative juices flowing, but remember, these are just starting points. Feel free to come up with your own unique idea!

AI Chatbot: An interactive bot that can communicate intelligently with users, providing information or services.
AI Tutor: An educational app that can teach a specific subject, answer queries, or provide learning resources.
Approaches:

Decide on the App: Brainstorm with the AI, and then you should decide what kind of app you want to create. Ask the AI to give you 50 app ideas. If you don't like any, ask for 50 more.
Start Coding with AI: Begin writing your code using your chosen AI teammate(s). Remember, the purpose is to let the AI(s) write the majority of the code. You're there to guide and optimize it.
Test and Refine: Continually test your app and refine the code. Machine-generated code can sometimes be tricky, so you'll need to be patient and persistent.
Comments: Have the AI comment the code thoroughly.
Presentation: Prepare a short demonstration of your app and a brief explanation of how you used AI in its development for your video! 
Remember, the goal isn't just to complete the assignment—it's to have fun, be creative, and explore the fascinating possibilities of AI in coding. Embrace this opportunity to experience how AI can enhance your development process and let your creativity shine!

Now, it's time to let your creativity soar and team up with AI to make something incredible.
